<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> This algorithm is used for filtering noise produced by PPE (Prompt Particle Events). By default filtering is applied only over water.
Filter is applied to every single pixel separately, checking the difference between a pixel and its nearest four vertical neighbors.
 If the difference is higher than a threshold, the value of the pixel is replaced by the median of the pixel and its neighboring pixels.

    The processor supports the the following sensors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sentinel-3 OLCI Level2 W(F/R)R</li>
</ul>
<p>The algorithm is described in the following articles which are available online.</p>
